# Vigenere
Vigenere cipher decryption with python

<h2> Project Description</h2>
The Vigenère cipher is a classic method of encrypting alphabetic text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. This project focuses on developing a Python-based implementation of the Vigenère cipher specifically for decryption, allowing users to decode ciphertext messages using a keyword. The objective is to create a reliable and user-friendly tool that can decrypt messages encoded with the Vigenère cipher. </br>

<h2>Key Tasks and Features</h2>

<h2>tools</h2>

-  Python

-  Jupyter Notebook

## Note: For the code to execute successfully, make sure that both the dictionary.txt, the encrypted file and the code.pynb files are in the same directory.
